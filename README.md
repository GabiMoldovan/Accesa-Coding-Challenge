# Accesa-Coding-Challenge

To run the project:

0. Make sure that you have Java installed correctly.
THE PROJECT RUNS ON JAVA 21

1. Clone it

2. Create the PostGreSQL database. Name it AccesaInternship

3. Open the project and change the database credentials in the application.properties in the resources folder.
If you have the default pgAdmin settings, use the same username, but modify the spring.datasource.password=1337 with your own password.
Also change the name of the databse if you didn't name it AccesaInternship

4. If you want to view the data in the table, add the database (the sidebar on the right, there is the database icon right above the maven one).
Click on New, Data Source, then select PostGreSQL. Put your user, password, and the name of the databse.

In this file, you will find the documentation for implementing the project.
It has all the progress throughout each day.
